## Tutorials
There are a great many tutorials for the gen 3 decomps, and the list keeps growing with each passing day! The decomp that gets the most attention here is pokeemerald (and by association pokeemerald-expansion). However, if you're finding a lack of pokefirered tutorials, remember that both pokefirered and pokeemerald are written in the C programming language, so a lot of what works for one can probably work for the other (usually with some minor code tweaking).

* [**The pokeemerald wiki**](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki): There is a whole tutorials section here with contributions from countless hackers. The tutorials are organized by section, so it is easy to find the kind of tutorial you're looking for. Feel free to contribute to it if you come up with something new yourself.

* [Team Aqua's Hideout Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLNv9Lq6kDmTIYfN5NvgQRvfOHTOXl0uU): Some of the videos are a bit outdated, but this playlist is still one of the best ways to get to know how the decomps work.

* [pokecommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/forums/decomp-disassembly-tutorials.475/): These forums contain tutorials for both disassemblies (gen 1 and 2) and decomps. This list is a little harder to sort through, and some of these tutorials are also represented in the pokeemerald wiki, but there are some very useful guides in here if you take the time to look for them.
