## Introduction

You've decided you want to hack a Pokémon GBA ROM. Great! Welcome to the world of gen 3 ROM hacking!

There are two different ways to hack: Binary and Decomps.

***Binary***: Binary hacking is what most people think of for hacking Pokémon. This is the traditional way of doing things. You take a ROM and use a variety of programs to directly edit that ROM's code. While still useful, binary hacking will not be covered in this guide. We will be using something completely different.

***Decomps***: The code within a GBA ROM is generally unreadable to most humans. However, the code for both the Emerald and FireRed versions of Pokémon have been decompiled into a programming language that is much easier for people to work with: the C programming language. This allows us to make changes to the code more directly and in more specific ways. Because it is a decomp, we are not working with a ROM directly; we make the changes we want to the code and then compile a brand new ROM that includes our changes. It is thanks to [pret](https://github.com/pret) that we have these decomps to work with. ("Decomp" is short for "decompilation.")

[Here is an overview](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Why-should-I-use-this-over-binary-hacking) of the differences between the two hacking methods and the advantages of using a decomp over binary hacking (by LOuroboros).

This beginner's guide is mostly informed by information I have stumbled into over time, as well as my own personal experiences. If anyone has any suggestions for additions or changes to this guide, please send me a message [on pokecommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/conversations/add?to=Bivurnum) or [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bivurnum/). You can also contact me if you have any questions about the decomps. I'm no expert, but I'm happy to help however I can.
