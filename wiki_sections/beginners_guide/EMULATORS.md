## Emulators
*Contributors: Bivurnum and RavePossum*

Emulators are programs that allow you to run games outside of their original hardware. We use emulators that simulate how the GameBoy Advance works, so we don't have to use a physical GBA in order to run our hacked ROMs. They come in handy for testing any changes we make to the decomp.

### For Computer
* [**mGBA**](https://mgba.io/): From what I hear, this is the emulator that most accurately simulates how the GBA works. It works on many different devices, including some video game consoles (like Wii and 3DS), making it highly accessible to players. Making sure your ROM hack works with mGBA is a good way to ensure that many people will have the ability to run it correctly.

Most other computer emulators, like Visual Boy Advance, tend to be unreliable. The mGBA emulator is the one that is recommended above all others.

### For Phones
While not really useful for testing changes, it is worth mentioning these as ways for players to run ROM hacks.

* [**Lemuroid**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swordfish.lemuroid&hl=en_US&gl=US): This is only compatible with Android phones, but it is free.
* [**Pizza Boy**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.dbtecno.pizzaboygba&hl=en_US): Another Android exclusive.
* [**Delta**](https://faq.deltaemulator.com/): It hasn't been around super long, but it is likely one of the more accessible ways for people to play GBA ROMs on their phones. As far as I know, it is the only functional and free phone emulator that is on all the official app stores and works on both Android and iOS.
* [**RetroArch**](https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms): From what I hear, this application can run the mGBA emulator on a variety of devices, including phones (both Android and iOS).

The John GBA and My Boy emulators are discouraged because they are notorious for not running ROM hacks very well.
