The amazing team with ROM Hacking Hideout (RHH) have spent years putting together a version of pokeemerald that includes modern Pokémon mechanics and a plethora of quality of life features. The amount of features they've added is staggeringly large, but here is a general list of features that make pokeemerald-expansion great:
* Physical/Special Split: Games from gen 4 onward had the individual Pokémon moves designated as doing either physical or special damage (ie, Waterfall is physical while Surf is special), rather than the gen 3 moves whose physical/special designation was tied only to the move's type. This brings the game up to the more modern standard.
* Modern Battle Engine: Battle mechanics change with each new generation of Pokémon games. Most game's battle mechanics are included in pokeemerald-expansion and can be individually toggled to different generation standards. For example, you could set the move Toxic to have the gen 4 mechanic where the accuracy is unaffected by the attacking Pokémon's type, while aslo setting the gen 6 mechanic where Pokémon gain experience when you capture a wild Pokémon. It is highly customizable to your needs.
* All Pokémon Species: As of this writing, the expansion includes all official Pokémon species from the main games through the gen 9 DLCs.
* Mega Evolution, Z-moves, and Dynamax: All of these features are implemented with the same mechanics they had in their respective releases. Terastalizing is not yet fully implemented.
* All Items: All of the items from the various mainline games are included in the expansion.

While pokeemerald-expansion is based on pokeemerald, it is not meant to be just an updated version of Emerald. In fact, several of the expansion's developers have stated that they don't think the game is beatable in its current state. The intent behind the expansion is to give hackers a base to work with that has as many options already baked into it as possible. It isn't its own ROM hack, it is a sophisticated tool for people to use to create their own ROM hacks. If you are looking to include modern mechanics in your ROM hack, I highly suggest you start with pokeemerald-expansion.
