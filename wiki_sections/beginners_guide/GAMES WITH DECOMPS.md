## Games with Decomps
*Contributors: Bivurnum*

* [**pokeemerald**](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/INSTALL.md): The decomp of Pokémon Emerald. This is the one with the most documentation, tutorials, and support. There is also [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/Bivurnum/decomps-resources/wiki/pokeemerald%E2%80%90expansion), which is a highly enhanced version of pokeemerald. The expansion is covered in more detail in its own section.
* [**pokefirered**](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered/blob/master/INSTALL.md): The decomp of Pokémon FireRed. This is the one to chose when you specifically want a gen 1 remake as your ROM base. While not as extensively supported as pokeemerald, pokefirered functions similarly to pokeemerald and many of the tutorials can be applied to both.

While pokeruby exists, it has minimal support and Ruby is so similar to Emerald in structure that you are better off using pokeemerald instead.
There are no decomps for LeafGreen or Sapphire because they are so similar to their counterpart games.

I won't be covering them in this guide, but it is worth mentioning that these Pokémon spinoff games for the GBA also have decomps:
* [**pokepinballrs**](https://github.com/pret/pokepinballrs): Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire
* [**pmd-red**](https://github.com/pret/pmd-red/blob/master/INSTALL.md): Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team

They are not decomps, but the gen 1 and gen 2 games (GB & GBC) have disassemblies that work similarly to decomps. The main difference here is that they are written in their own assembly languages, not C. As such, they have their own sets of tools and tutorials separate from decomps. Consult their respective repository wikis for more information:
* [**pokered**](https://github.com/pret/pokered/wiki/Tutorials): Pokémon Red
* [**pokecrystal**](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki): Pokémon Crystal
